STEPS TO RUN THE PROJECT
========================

1. INSTALL PYTHON
   Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.9 or higher).

2. OPEN TERMINAL
   Open Command Prompt (cmd) or PowerShell and navigate to the project folder:
   cd c:\Users\hp\Downloads\humanli_ai_task

3. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
   Run this command to install the required libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. SETUP API KEY
   Make sure you have your Google Gemini API Key.
   It is already configured in the .env file and .streamlit/secrets.toml file properly.
   
   If you need to change it, editing .env is sufficient:
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

5. RUN THE APP
   Run the following command to start the Chatbot:
   streamlit run app.py

   (If 'streamlit' is not recognized, try: python -m streamlit run app.py)

6. USE THE APP
   - The browser will open automatically at http://localhost:8501
   - Enter a website URL (e.g., https://example.com)
   - Click "Process URL"
   - Wait for "Content processed!" message
   - Ask your questions in the chat box

TROUBLESHOOTING
- If you see "StreamlitSecretNotFoundError", don't worry, the app now handles this by checking .env too.
- If you see "404 models not found", it means the specific Gemini model isn't active for your key. We have set it to 'gemini-3-Flash-preview' which works.
- To restart, press Ctrl+C in the terminal to stop, then run the command again.
